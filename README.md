BlockShare: Undergraduate graduation project
=========

## Intellectual Property Managment Using Blockhain

 * Project aims to develop a fully digital platform to allow secure transfer of intellectual properties between consenting parties.
 * This repository hosts the user facing Android mobile app which is used to transfer the IP files from seller to buyer.
 * The transfer of IPs is logged by use of a public blockchain (blockchain miner code hosted [here](https://github.com/kiranajay07/bsminer-ide)).
 * The assets transfers are IDed using file hashes and permanently linked to the transactions and their respective timestamp. The same public blockchain could be used to validate transactions.
 
### Requirements

 * Android Studio 3.1+
 * Device with Android 8.0+
